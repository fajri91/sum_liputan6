# Liputan6: Summarization Corpus for Indonesian

## About

Liputan6 is the first large-scale Indonesian corpus for Abstractive and Extractive summarization. 
This data is from year 2000 - 2010, and has two sets:

| Data          | Train    | Dev      | Test      |
| ------------- | :-------:| --------:|  --------:|
| Canonical     | 193,883  | 10,972   | 10,972    |
| Xtreme        | 193,883  |  4,948   |  3,862    |

Liputan6 is registered as a new dataset in [IndoLEM](https://indolem.github.io/) (Indonesian resource collection encompassing morpho-syntax, semantics, and discourse).

## Obtaining Liputan6 Data

#### Disclaimer
Although Liputan6 is a publicly available online news portal, according to Indonesian Copyright Law Number 28 Year 2014, this corpus can only be used for non-commercialized activities such as academic research. It is STRONGLY FORBIDDEN to use this corpus as well as any summarization models created using this corpus for commercialized activities.
We highly encourage for another respective researcher to not re-distribute the dataset.

#### Way1 - By filling the form

Please fill this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bFkimFsZoswKCbUa76yHqi9hizLrJYne-1G_r5unfww/edit?usp=sharing). A url to download Liputan6 corpus will be sent to your email address.

#### Way2 - By running the codes

* First, please download a json file, containing urls of Liputan6 [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17eZ6D-iKBA5rmD8KQg0vr9tvobqmWUT9/view?usp=sharing). Put file `url.json` in this repository.
* Please run the following codes (tested in Python 3.7). If you want to increase `number of thread`, please adjust the code manually.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python 0_download.py
python 1_preprocessing.py
python 2_create_extractive_label.py
python 3_get_xtreme.py
```
* If you want to run pointer generator network, and BERT-based summarization model, data preparation is as followed:
```
python 4_make_data_files_pg.py
python 5_make_data_files_presumm_mbert.py
```

## Training Neural Models

* Pointer Generator Network: [PG](https://github.com/becxer/pointer-generator/).
* Bert-based summarization Model: [PreSumm](https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm). IndoBERT model used in the paper can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/indolem/indobert-base-uncased).

## Test Set Output

We also provide test set output as reported in our paper. You can download them [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10t5IzDXPCejNNZkVCgdI2KNt4CFxr6jG/view?usp=sharing).
